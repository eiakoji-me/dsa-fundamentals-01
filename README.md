# 🧠 DSA From First Principles

A structured journey to deeply understand **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** — inspired by the learning approach in mathematics. This project combines insights from *Data Structures and Algorithms Made Easy* by Narasimha Karumanchi with a personalized fundamentals roadmap.

---

## 📘 Goal

Master DSA by understanding concepts deeply, implementing clean, language-agnostic versions, and solving curated exercises without relying on LeetCode or similar platforms — for now.

---

## 🧭 Study Approach

For each topic, we cover:

1. **What it is** – Concept and formal definition
2. **Why it matters** – Real-world relevance and intuition
3. **How it works** – Internals, models, and examples
4. **How to implement it** – Clean pseudocode and base implementation
5. **Exercises** – Small set of custom-designed problems
